title: Ignore a source
slug: Tools/Debugger/How_to/Ignore_a_source
summary: >-
  In modern web development, we often rely on libraries like jQuery, Ember, or
  Angular, and 99% of the time we can safely assume that they “just work”. We
  don’t care about the internal implementation of these libraries. However, a library’s abstraction leaks during debugging
  sessions when you are forced to step through its stack frames in order to
  reach your own code. You can tell the debugger to ignore
  the details of selected sources.

<p>Hello, again, Peter!</p>
<p>In modern web development, we often rely on libraries like <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, and 99% of the time we can safely assume that they “just work”. We don’t care about the internal implementation of these libraries. However, a library’s abstraction leaks during debugging sessions when you are forced to step through its stack frames in order to reach your own code. You can tell the debugger to ignore the details of selected sources.</p>

<p>To enable or disable ignoring a source file, select the source in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour#Source_list_pane">source list pane</a> and click the eyeball icon at the bottom left:</p>

<p>When a source is ignored:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Any breakpoints it may have are disabled.</li>
 <li>When “Pause on Exceptions” is enabled in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Settings">Debugger settings</a>, the debugger won’t pause when an exception is thrown in the ignored source; instead it will wait until (and if) the stack unwinds to a frame in a source that isn’t ignored.</li>
 <li>The debugger will skip through ignored sources when stepping.</li>
</ul>
